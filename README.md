# The Purpose of this project
The world is more educated than ever. We are outsourcing our intelligence to AI, and increasingly seeing companies replace their employees with AI. When engineers and developers are fired, they have two options:
1. Find a new job
2. Become an entrepreneur

Painpoint Miner addresses the second option - making it easier for engineers and developers to become entrepreneurs. One of the core components of Painpoint miner looks at lowering the barrier to entry for engineers that want to become entrepreneurs. The world's biggest painpoint is trying to find the painpoints themselves. 

## Other use cases
If a company is interested in outcompeting other companies in the area, they may want to understand painpoints that are unique to industries in their local area. They may want to use Painpoint Miner in order to find these painpoints to improve their business. 

For example, if a pizza restaurant is interested in creating more business in London, they may want to understand the common painpoints experienced by pizza restaurants in London. It may be that, for London specifically, the most important painpoint is related to _quality_, whereas in Birmingham the most important painpoint is _delivery time_. Without Painpoint Miner, the pizza restaurant may focus resources in improving their delivery time, whereas with Painpoint Miner, the pizza restaurant will invest resources where they will see the biggest results.
